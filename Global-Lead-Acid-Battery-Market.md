Key Market Dynamics Driving Growth
The deployment of 5G network infrastructure has become a global priority as countries race to modernize their digital ecosystems. This transition is creating a significant market opportunity for chip manufacturers. One of the primary growth drivers is the expanding use of 5G-enabled smartphones and consumer devices, which require advanced chipsets to support higher data speeds and lower power consumption.

Additionally, the surge in machine-to-machine communication, which plays a critical role in industrial automation and smart logistics, is fueling the demand for 5G chipsets. The ability of 5G networks to support billions of connected devices simultaneously makes them essential for future industrial applications.

Despite the strong growth outlook, the market faces challenges such as high hardware costs, particularly related to network densification and spectrum management. Fragmented spectrum allocation in various countries also creates deployment barriers. However, ongoing technological innovation, strategic collaborations among industry players, and increased manufacturing efficiency are expected to mitigate these obstacles over time.

Segment Analysis: ASIC Leads, mmWave IC Records Fastest Growth
The 5G Chip Market is segmented based on IC type, operational frequency, product category, and industrial vertical. Among IC types, ASIC chipsets held the largest market share in 2024, contributing nearly 48% of total revenue. The preference for custom-designed chips offering superior performance and energy efficiency continues to support this segment’s dominance.

Meanwhile, the mmWave IC segment is forecasted to grow at the highest CAGR of 55.3% during the forecast period. The rising adoption of millimeter-wave technology in automotive, healthcare, and industrial automation applications is driving this exponential growth. mmWave ICs are essential for enabling ultra-high-speed communication and supporting bandwidth-intensive applications such as AR/VR and connected vehicles.

Other chipset categories, including RFIC and cellular IC, also play a vital role in enabling robust 5G infrastructure and are expected to exhibit steady growth.

Automotive Sector Emerging as a Major End-User
The automotive and transportation sector is projected to be one of the fastest-growing end-user segments during the forecast period. The emergence of connected cars, intelligent traffic management, and vehicle-to-everything communication is creating a strong need for 5G chipsets. Applications such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-network (V2N) rely heavily on real-time data transmission, which is only possible through advanced 5G chip-based systems.

These advancements are expected to support the development of autonomous driving, automated navigation, and digital logistics, further boosting demand for 5G chipsets in the automotive industry.

Operational Frequency Trends Strengthening Market Potential
In terms of operational frequency, chipsets designed to work in the 26–39 GHz frequency range are expected to exhibit the highest growth. Their ability to handle multiple 5G devices simultaneously, while offering seamless connectivity, makes them a preferred choice for advanced 5G-enabled environments.

Lower frequency sub-6GHz chipsets continue to dominate early-stage deployments because of their wider coverage, but higher frequency ranges are gradually gaining traction due to their superior data speed and capacity benefits.
